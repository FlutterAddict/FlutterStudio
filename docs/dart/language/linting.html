  <h1>Dart Linting</h1>
  <p>The Dart Linter package defines lint rules that identify and report on "lints" found in Dart code.</p>
  <p>Linting is performed by the Dart analysis server and the dartanalyzer commandline tool.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Installing</h2>
    <p>The linter is bundled with the <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk">Dart SDK</a>. If you have an updated Dart SDK already, you're done!</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>The linter gives you feedback to help you catch potential errors and keep your code in line with <a href="#">Effective Dart Style Guide</a>.</p>
    <p>You can find the list of lints you can use <a href="https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>configuration</h3>
      <p>create new file at the root of the package, in the same directory as the <code>pubspec.yaml</code> file and name it <code>analysis_options.yaml</code>.</p>
      <p>Here's a basic template of this file you can use:</p>
<pre><code>analyzer:
  options:
    #treat missing required params as a warning and not just a hint
    missing_required_params: warning 

linter:
  rules:
    camel_case_types
    # find out more linter rules in our Effective Dart Style Guide</code></pre>
      <p>Note: Use two spaces instead of tab in .yaml files.</p>
