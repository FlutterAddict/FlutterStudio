  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>There are two main overarching themes from writing consistent, robust, fast code.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Consistency</h2>
    <p>Be consistent with your code.</p>
    <p>When it comes to things like formatting and casing, arguments about which one is better are subjective and impossible to resolve.</p>
    <p>What we do know, is that being consistent is objectively helpful.</p>
    <p>If two pieces of code look different, it should be because they are different in some meaningful way.</p>
    <p>When a bit of code stands out and catches your eye, it should do for a useful reason.</p>

    <h2>Briefness</h2>
    <p>Be brief with your code.</p>
    <p>Dart was designed to be familiar, so it inherits many of the same statements and expressions as C, Java, JavaScript and other languages.</p>
    <p>But Dart was created because there is a lot of room to improve on what those languages offer.</p>
    <p>If there are many ways to say something, you should generally pick the most concise one.</p>
    <p>That doesn't mean you should cram your whole program into single line. The goal is to be economical, not dense.</p>
