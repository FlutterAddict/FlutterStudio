    <h2>Widget's <code>build()</code> Function</h2>
    <p>A widget's main job is to implement a <code>build()</code> function, which describes a widget in terms of other, lower-level widgets.</p>
    <p>The framework builds those widgets in turn until the process bottoms out in widgets that represent the underlying <code>RenderObject</code>, which computes and describes the geometry of the Widget.</p>
