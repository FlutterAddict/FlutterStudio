  <h1>Custom Widgets</h1>
  <p>Learn what are Stateless and Stateful widgets and how to create your own, custom Flutter widgets.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget</h2>
    <p>There are 2 kinds of Flutter Widgets - StatefulWidgets and StatelessWidgets.</p>
    <p>If a Widget manages any state - it is a StatefulWidget. If not - it's StatelessWidget.</p>

    <h2>Widget's <code>build()</code> Function</h2>
    <p>A widget's main job is to implement a <code>build()</code> function, which describes a widget in terms of other, lower-level widgets.</p>
    <p>The framework builds those widgets in turn until the process bottoms out in widgets that represent the underlying <a href="#">RenderObject</a>, which computes and describes the geometry of the Widget.</p>

    <h2>Creating StatelessWidget</h2>
    <p>Creating your own, custom Stateless Widgets is really straightforward and easy.</p>
    <p>You just create new class which extends the <code>StatelessWidget</code> class and define the <code>build()</code> function.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Example #1</h3>
<pre><code>import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(TheApp());
}

class TheApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('Hello World', 
        textDirection: TextDirection.ltr
      ),
    ),
  }
}</code></pre>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Example #2</h3>
      <p>We'll recreate the material app from example in previous lesson, but this time we'll split the Material components into their own Stateless Widgets.</p>
