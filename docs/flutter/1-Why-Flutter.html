    <h2>What is Flutter?</h2>
    <p>Flutter is free, open-source framework made by Google for building cross-platform apps.</p>

    <h2>Why Flutter</h2>
    <p>With Flutter, you can create beautiful, butter-smooth, performant apps faster than ever, without compromising on quality or performance.</p>

      <h3>Hot Reload</h3>
      <p>Sub-second reload times will allow you to quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features and fix bugs. Moreover, you'll not lose the state of the app after the reload.</p>
      <p>You can test the apps on emulators, simulators or your Android or iOS smartphone.</p>
      <p>You'll find this especially useful if you come from native Android development where you have to rebuild your app every time.</p>

      <h3>Great VS Code Support</h3>
      <p>Developers who doesn't have powerful machines will appreciate the fact that you can create and build your apps straight from the Visual Studio Code.</p>
      <p>You don't even have to open the RAM eater Android Studio.</p>
      <p>Of course it supports Inteliij IDEA, Android Stuido and XCODE too.</p>

    <h2>How about React Native?</h2>
    <p>React Native is the biggest competitor to flutter and the best alternative to it, but Flutter beats React Native in most aspects.</p>
    <p>I learnt React Native development first and I was trying to build an app but gave up after months of wrestling with it.</p>
    <p>Then I decided to learn Flutter, and and I'm trurly amazed with it.</p>
    <p>I've even written an article about it, I compared those two frameworks in detail, so if you're interested <a href="#">check it out</a>.</p>
