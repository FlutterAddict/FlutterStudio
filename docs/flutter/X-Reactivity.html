  <h2>Flutter is Reactive</h2>

  <p>But what does it actually mean?</p>

  <p>Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current configuration and state.</p>

  <p>When a widget's state changes, the widget rebuilds its description and the framework diffs against previous description in order to determine minimal changes needed in the underlying render tree to transition from one state to next.</p>

  <p>That makes Flutter Reactive.</p>
