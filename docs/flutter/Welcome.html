  <h1>Welcome to Flutter Studio</h1>

  <p>Flutter Studio is a more beginner-friendly alternative to <a href="https://flutter.dev/">official Flutter docs</a>.</p>

  <p>Soon it will offer much more than just documentation, but for now, Flutter Studio is in a very early stage of development and I'm working on it every day to bring you many more exciting features.</p>
