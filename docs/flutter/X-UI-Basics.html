  <h1>User Interface Basics</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Widgets, Widgets Everywhere</h2>
    <p>In Flutter, we build user interfaces using Widgets.</p>
    <p>Everything in Flutter app is a widget.</p>
    <p>You have widgets for animations, for building layouts, and even the app itself is a widget.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Hello World</h2>
    <p>Let's write an app that will only show "Hello World" in the middle of the screen:</p>
<pre><code>import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // import Flutter to our Dart program

// main, as you should already know is a special, top-level, required function
void main() {
  runApp(
    Center(
      child: Text(
        'Hello World',
        textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
      ),
    ),
  );
}</code></pre>
    <p>Let's break it down.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><code>import 'package:flutter/material.dart';</code> is basically how we import the Flutter framework into our Dart program.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>void main() { ... }</code> as you may already from Dart guide, is the entry point of any Dart program.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>runApp(...)</code> makes the given widget the root of the widget tree and forces it to cover the screen.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>Center(...)</code> is a simple widget that centers its child within itself.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>Text(...)</code> is a widget that displays the text to the screen. The <code>textDirection</code> must be specified when we don't use <code>MaterialApp</code> (we'll get into this later).</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>And that's it. In summary - all we do is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>import the Flutter's material.dart package</p></li>
      <li><p>create the <code>void main()</code> method</p></li>
      <li><p>call the <code>runApp(RootWidget)</code> method provided by Flutter's material.dart package </p></li>
      <li><p>and pass the widget we want to be the root of our application to it, which is in this case the <code>Center()</code> widget.</p></li>
      <li><p>We pass the <code>Text()</code> widget to the <code>Center()</code> widget as its child.</p></li>
    </ul>
