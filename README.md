# Flutter Studio
Ultra-fast, mobile-friendly, featherweight docs, guides, examples and tools for both beginner and experienced Flutter developers. Supports dark theme but you can toggle it if you want.   

The Web App is extremely lightweight thanks to no framework or external libraries used.   
It's powered by minimum amount of HTML5, CSS3 (I used SASS pre-compiller) and pure JavaScript (ES6+ compiled down with WebPack).   


## To-do:
- HTML5 History based Navigation
- Add Honeycrumbs
- Content and tools will come.
