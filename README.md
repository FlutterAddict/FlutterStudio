# Flutter Studio
Ultra-fast, mobile-friendly, featherweight docs, guides, examples and tools for both beginner and experienced Flutter developers.   

Supports dark theme but you can toggle it if you want.   

The Web App is extremely lightweight (2.69KB JS bundle, React is 133KB) thanks to no framework or external libraries used.   
   
It's powered by minimum amount of HTML5, CSS3 (I used SASS pre-compiller) and pure JavaScript (ES6+ compiled down with WebPack).   



## To-do:
- HTML5 History based Navigation
- Icons, Make it Offline
- Add Honeycrumbs
- Content and tools will come.



## Tech Used
- HTML5
- CSS, SASS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- WebPack
- AJAX
- RWD
