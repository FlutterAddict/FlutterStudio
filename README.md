# FlutterStudio
Alternative documentation to the official, guides, examples and tools for both beginner and experienced Flutter developers.   

The Web App is extremely lightweight thanks to no framework or external libraries used.   
It's powered by minimum amount of HTML5, CSS3 (I used SASS pre-compiller) and pure JavaScript (ES6+ compiled down with WebPack).   


## To-do:
- HTML5 History based Navigation
- Content and tools will come."# FlutterStudio"
